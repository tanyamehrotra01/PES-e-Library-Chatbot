b) L U Σ*
c) Σ*
d) no change in the Language

4. A pair of states is distinguishable if

b) both states on at least one input should go to the same state
c) both states should be reachable from an earlier state on the same input

b) left linear grammar generates the leftmost symbols in the string first.
c) Generation of the string does not depend on whether the grammar is left linear or right linear
